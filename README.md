# Crypto Wallet App

We need to have a simple Web app which is able to integrate with:
**MetaMask** - https://metamask.io/

### The user should be able to:

- Connect with MetaMask
  - **Bonus:** Add support for other Wallets as well.
- Once connected, weâ€™d like to gather the following information, nicely presented to the user:
  - The current Address that User uses
  - The Network that the User has selected
  - Ethereum balance of the User
  - Nexo Token balance of the User
  - Automatically detect any Tokens that the User has and showcase them as well and the Balance of them
  - **Bonus:** Add the ability for Users to be able to do Swaps of their tokens using **Uniswap**
- We want the User to have the ability to get more information for the Displayed Tokens.
  - Things like:
    - Symbol of the Token
    - Decimals
    - Total Supply
- Add a Warning that tells the User that he has not Selected Mainnet and should switch his network.

UX, styling and attention to detail is up to you.

### What can be used:

- ReactJS
- Redux (if needed)
- Webpack
- Any other library considered necessary
